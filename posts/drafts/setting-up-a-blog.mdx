## Netlify and Formik

## Netlify functions for integration with 3rd party servicews

I decided to go with SendInBlue after checking a few... (maybe more details in a separate post).
Netlify automatically handle the form submission, but we still need to write some code to call the SendInBlue API

Create a file named _submission-created.js_ (you must use this name!) in your netlify/functions folder
The handler will be invoked automatically everytime a form is submitted ([details here](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/trigger-on-events/)).

```
const SibApiV3Sdk = require('sib-api-v3-sdk');

let defaultClient = SibApiV3Sdk.ApiClient.instance;
let apiKey = defaultClient.authentications['api-key'];
apiKey.apiKey = process.env.SENDINBLUE_API_KEY;

exports.handler = async function (event, context) {
    console.log(event);
    let body = JSON.parse(event.body);
    let payload = body.payload;

    if (!payload.email) {
        console.log('missing email')
        return callback(null, {
            statusCode: 400,
            body: JSON.stringify({
                error: 'missing email'
            })
        })
    }
    console.log("Sending data to SendInBlue");

    // Subscribe an email
    let apiInstance = new SibApiV3Sdk.ContactsApi();
    let createContact = new SibApiV3Sdk.CreateContact();

    createContact.email = payload.email;
    createContact.listIds = [2]

    try {
        let data = await apiInstance.createContact(createContact);
        console.log('API called successfully. Returned data: ' + JSON.stringify(data));
        return {
            statusCode: 200
        };
    } catch (e) {
        console.error(e);
        return {
            statusCode: 500
        };
    }
};
```
