## During development

- The function **filenames** are used to auto-magically configure the automated triggers ([function trigger docs](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/trigger-on-events/))
- During development, you can use the netlify CLI to invoke functions see - _netlify functions:invoke_ or _netlify functions:serve_
- Environment variables are managed from within the Netlify dashboard. They are not read from .env.local, and they are **not** updated till you restart the dev server
- Debugging - Is there a better way to debug than using console.log?

## Deploying

Some things to think about:

- Functions are deployed to AWS us-east-1 ([docs](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/)). How to go about multi-region deployments?
- Logging -The Netlify dashboard provides basic access to recent logs.
You'll need a (paid) [log drain](https://docs.netlify.com/monitor-sites/log-drains/) in order to access the logs programmatically.
- Monitoring - not sure how this can be done
